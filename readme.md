# Tesla Live Graphing
The intention here is to learn how to use live data streaming, and build some live graphs using grafana and kinesis
that show various metrics from our tesla, immediately.

This will require running a docker container on a local server that captures this data, and this container being accessible to IOT as a source on AWS.
